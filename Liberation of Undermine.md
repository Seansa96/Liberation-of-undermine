# Vexie and the Geargrinders - Boss 1

* Boss immune at start
* Bikers will charge. Need to have them charge over Oil Spills to be killed
* Once they're killed, hop on bike and throw it at the boss
* Clear excess oil spills with fire
* Save CDs and lust for when all plating is gone, burn boss
* Repeat
* Dodge
* Tanks swap on each Tank Buster
# Cauldron of Carnage - Boss 2

* Tank bosses apart, split raid. They take 99% less damage if in 40 yds. **Bosses should die around same time**. Deals increasing damage if they don't. Swap groups or Swap tanks at 10-15(?) stacks.
* Everytime they hit full energy (unknown interval), they'll **clash**, doing big damage and spawning swirlies and waves. Also ticking damage during the **Clash,** lasts 20 seconds. Dodge and do dam. Each **clash** deals more and more damage.
**Dino (Flarendo the Furious)**
* Fire damage
* Debuff is called **Blistering Spite**
* **Scrapbomb** - Soak that needs around 3-5 people in a 10 man. 10 seconds to soak it. Everyone who soaks gets a dot that splashes for 30 seconds, then leaves a pool when it expires. Likely need one half of the Dino group to soak it then the other half. First group should place pools far as they can. Pools also shoot out waves periodically.
* **Blastburn Roarcannon** - Will pick a target and lock on them. After 3 seconds, will beam the target spot, probably killing anyone caught.
* Tank mechanic is a knockup that deals high damage.
**Monkey (Torq the Tempest)**
* Nature Damage
* Debuff is **Galvanized Spite**
* Main mechanic on this side is called **Static Charge**. Not known if it's a boss bar or actual debuff. Small dot, and has a maximum amount of charge it can reach. Charge increases when moving and depletes when stationary.  If you reach max charge, you stun yourself and everyone 10 yds around for 6 seconds.
* Swirlies to dodge, keep movement to a minimum.
* **Voltaic Images** - Boss will spawn clones that fixate on players and try to reach them. When they do, they deal moderate damage and leave a silencing pool underneath that deals low damage. Not known if cc'able or if you move out and let them hit you.
* Tank mechanic is a weak physical hit, unmitigated damage converted to nature damage.

# Rik Reverb - Boss 3
* Main mechanic are **Amplifiers** placed around the room. These gain power over time. If any reach max power, likely a wipe.
* **Amps** drop in periodically. If you're hit by them dropping in, you take high damage and are stunned and knocked.
* Players can click on an **Amplifie**r to drain its power, but get a debuff that makes them take more nature damage. Need players to rotate clicking Amps.
* Besides this, each **Amp** does: low ticking damage to the whole raid, and shoot out **Resonant Echoes**
* Can only be hit once every 6 seconds. **If you're hit by two, you're MC'd for a minute and (probably) dead.**
* **Echoing Chant** - Simultaneously activates all **Amplifiers**, making them shout out Resonant Echoes at the same time. Big dodge situation.
* **Sound Cannon** - Picks a random player and shoots a line at them. By the wording, probably not dodgeable for the player so they should either plant and others move or gtfo of the raid.
* **Faulty Zap** - Picks a few players and afflicts them with a high damage DoT that also increases their nature damage taken for 12 seconds. They also splash damage 5 yards around them. Players should probably wait to click on their Amp until this goes away if they have to do it soon.
* **Sparkblast Ignition** - Bombs will be spawned that need to be killed. 15 seconds to kill them. Doing damage to them makes them shoot out swirlies that need to be dodged. Dealing damage to these gives a stacking haste and movement speed buff.
* Boss makes any amps close to him (15 yards) gain power quicker.
* Tank mechanic is a stacking Sonic DMG taken debuff. 100% a stack.  Cleaves to anyone in front of boss as well.
When Rik hits full energy, he'll do a **Hype Hustle,** which lasts 36 seconds. **The Third Hype Hustle has no end and is the soft enrage.**
* All amps will **Blowout!** causing them to explode, dealing very light damage and knocking up any players within 10 yards into the air. This is the only way to dodge **Blaring Drop!,** which is a ring that grows outward (Artificer/Queen), dealing lethal damage to anyone caught by it.
# Stix Bunkjunker
* Main mechanic is Rolling Rubbish. Random players will be turned into a big ball. Boss spawns garbage piles throughout the fight. You have a bar that keeps track of garbage you've ran over. Can run over small garbage/hyenas at first, then bigger garbage/scrapmasters.
* Boss summons an increasing amount of Doomsplosives. These need to be ran over by a large enough Rolling Rubbish, or they wipe you. Need a full bar basically to run them over.
* Boss will periodically mark several players with a small fire debuff that gives them a small circle. If they run over other players or garbage piles, they set them on fire.  Setting a garbage pile on fire makes it unable to be picked up and also causes raid damage until it despawns.
* Territorial bombshells spawn with each garbage pile wave. These cannot be moved or cc'ed until they drop below 75%. You have 30 seconds to kill them before they explode, doing a high amount of damage to the raid.  Running into these AFTER they are sub 75% causes them to explode immediately. INCREDIBLY HIGH PRIORITY.
* Other adds: Hyenas (small shit adds that can be picked up. Melee and does Infected Bite, a healing reduction disease), and Scrapmasters. Scrapmasters jump to random player locations and also do an interruptible, high damage channel.
* When the boss summons garbage piles, he also does moderate raid damage over time and spawns swirlies to dodge. 
* Occasionally he'll go into Overdrive, going immune to damage and flying in the air, spawning a ton of swirlies then crashing down into a location. Anything in that location after 5 seconds gets one shot, pretty much.
