# Vexie and the Geargrinders - Boss 1

* Boss immune at start
* Bikers will charge. Need to have them charge over Oil Spills to be killed
* Once they're killed, hop on bike and throw it at the boss
* Clear excess oil spills with fire
* Save CDs and lust for when all plating is gone, burn boss
* Repeat
* Dodge
* Tanks swap on each Tank Buster
# Cauldron of Carnage - Boss 2

* Tank bosses apart, split raid. They take 99% less damage if in 40 yds. **Bosses should die around same time**. Deals increasing damage if they don't. Swap groups or Swap tanks at 10-15(?) stacks.
* Everytime they hit full energy (unknown interval), they'll **clash**, doing big damage and spawning swirlies and waves. Also ticking damage during the **Clash,** lasts 20 seconds. Dodge and do dam. Each **clash** deals more and more damage.
**Dino (Flarendo the Furious)**
* Fire damage
* Debuff is called **Blistering Spite**
* **Scrapbomb** - Soak that needs around 3-5 people in a 10 man. 10 seconds to soak it. Everyone who soaks gets a dot that splashes for 30 seconds, then leaves a pool when it expires. Likely need one half of the Dino group to soak it then the other half. First group should place pools far as they can. Pools also shoot out waves periodically.
* **Blastburn Roarcannon** - Will pick a target and lock on them. After 3 seconds, will beam the target spot, probably killing anyone caught.
* Tank mechanic is a knockup that deals high damage.
**Monkey (Torq the Tempest)**
* Nature Damage
* Debuff is **Galvanized Spite**
* Main mechanic on this side is called **Static Charge**. Not known if it's a boss bar or actual debuff. Small dot, and has a maximum amount of charge it can reach. Charge increases when moving and depletes when stationary.  If you reach max charge, you stun yourself and everyone 10 yds around for 6 seconds.
* Swirlies to dodge, keep movement to a minimum.
* **Voltaic Images** - Boss will spawn clones that fixate on players and try to reach them. When they do, they deal moderate damage and leave a silencing pool underneath that deals low damage. Not known if cc'able or if you move out and let them hit you.
* Tank mechanic is a weak physical hit, unmitigated damage converted to nature damage.

# Rik Reverb - Boss 3
* Main mechanic are **Amplifiers** placed around the room. These gain power over time. If any reach max power, likely a wipe.
* **Amps** drop in periodically. If you're hit by them dropping in, you take high damage and are stunned and knocked.
* Players can click on an **Amplifie**r to drain its power, but get a debuff that makes them take more nature damage. Need players to rotate clicking Amps.
* Besides this, each **Amp** does: low ticking damage to the whole raid, and shoot out **Resonant Echoes**
* Can only be hit once every 6 seconds. **If you're hit by two, you're MC'd for a minute and (probably) dead.** NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, THIS IS PROBABLY LIKE DAUSEGNE(HOW TF DO U SPELL IT) AND UUNAT. DODGE THROUGH SPECIFIC RINGS SO YOU DON'T GET 2 STACKS.
* **Echoing Chant** - Simultaneously activates all **Amplifiers**, making them shout out Resonant Echoes at the same time.  
* **Sound Cannon** - Picks a random player and shoots a line at them. By the wording, probably not dodgeable for the player so they should either plant and others move or gtfo of the raid.
* **Faulty Zap** - Picks a few players and afflicts them with a high damage DoT that also increases their nature damage taken for 12 seconds. They also splash damage 5 yards around them. Players should probably wait to click on their Amp until this goes away if they have to do it soon.
* **Sparkblast Ignition** - Bombs will be spawned that need to be killed. 15 seconds to kill them. Doing damage to them makes them shoot out swirlies that need to be dodged. Dealing damage to these gives a stacking haste and movement speed buff.
* Boss makes any amps close to him (15 yards) gain power quicker.
* Tank mechanic is a stacking Sonic DMG taken debuff. 100% a stack.  Cleaves to anyone in front of boss as well.
When Rik hits full energy, he'll do a **Hype Hustle,** which lasts 36 seconds. **The Third Hype Hustle has no end and is the soft enrage.**
* All amps will **Blowout!** causing them to explode, dealing very light damage and knocking up any players within 10 yards into the air. This is the only way to dodge **Blaring Drop!,** which is a ring that grows outward (Artificer/Queen), dealing lethal damage to anyone caught by it.
# Stix Bunkjunker - Boss 4
* Main mechanic is Rolling Rubbish. Random players will be turned into a big ball. Boss spawns garbage piles throughout the fight. You have a bar that keeps track of garbage you've ran over. Can run over small garbage/hyenas at first, then bigger garbage/scrapmasters.
* Boss summons an increasing amount of Doomsplosives. These need to be ran over by a large enough Rolling Rubbish, or they wipe you. Need a full bar basically to run them over.
* Boss will periodically mark several players with a small fire debuff that gives them a small circle. If they run over other players or garbage piles, they set them on fire.  Setting a garbage pile on fire makes it unable to be picked up and also causes raid damage until it despawns.
* Territorial bombshells spawn with each garbage pile wave. These cannot be moved or cc'ed until they drop below 75%. You have 30 seconds to kill them before they explode, doing a high amount of damage to the raid.  Running into these AFTER they are sub 75% causes them to explode immediately. INCREDIBLY HIGH PRIORITY.
* Other adds: Hyenas (small shit adds that can be picked up. Melee and does Infected Bite, a healing reduction disease), and Scrapmasters. Scrapmasters jump to random player locations and also do an interruptible, high damage channel.
* When the boss summons garbage piles, he also does moderate raid damage over time and spawns swirlies to dodge. 
* Occasionally he'll go into Overdrive, going immune to damage and flying in the air, spawning a ton of swirlies then crashing down into a location. Anything in that location after 5 seconds gets one shot, pretty much.

# Sprocketmonger Lockenstock - Boss 5 (BOSS SEEMS VERY UNFINISHED, LIKELY TO CHANGE)
* Main mechanic is **Goblin Weaponry**. There are four different types of weapons (somewhat like Siegecrafter) you can get.  NOT KNOWN IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE OVER WHAT WEAPONS, OR IF IT IS RANDOM. SEEMS JUST RANDOM BASED ON OTHER MECHANICS. DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE TO KILL THEM EITHER, OR IF THEY'RE JUST ENTITIES THAT DO THEIR MECHANICS THEN LEAVE. ALSO UNKNOWN IF IT SPAWNS MULTIPLE OF THESE WEAPONS OR NOT.
Weapon Types:
* **Rocket Cannon** - Spawns swirlies to dodge every second for 4 seconds
* **Fire Turret** - Fires a laser beam that deals lethal damage to anything hit. Unknown if it's a random location and stationary or if it tracks a player, or if it just moves.
* **Mega Magnet** - Pulls its target towards it. Anything that touches it gets stunned. Doesn't say if they take damage, but I imagine it's probably near lethal if you touch it as well.
* **Firecracker Trap** - Spawns traps that root anything that runs over them, dealing pretty low damage (probably gonna change).
* Other main mechanic (Heroic and up) is **Product Deployment**. These spawns mines all over that explode on contact with players or **Goblin Weaponry**. Triggering a mine does raid damage, but also puts out a debuff increases damage taken from **Unstable Explosion** (the spell that actually does the raid damage) for 2 seconds. Obviously, you want these staggered. The player that triggers each mine gets a debuff preventing them from triggering another (well, a 1000% dmg taken increase from triggering) for ? seconds.
At 100 energy, he'll do **Beta Launch**, empowering a weapon type and knocking people away.  He'll do AoE dmg and a heal absorb on everyone.  He'll also do a swirlie rain. Getting hit disorients you...cringe.

Empowered Weapons
* **Void Laser** - Same thing basically as other laser.
* **Void Cannon** - Same thing as Rocket Cannon, except it also deals damage to everyone when the projectiles land.

OTHER MECHANICS

* **Screw up** - Spawns drills under you that erupt after a few seconds. They also seem to persist for some time, so might need to place them in good spots.
* **Wire Transfer** - Sets parts of the boss arena on...lightning. Slows anything and does high damage to anything on it.
* **Sonic Ba-Boom** - Raid rot dmg
* **Pyro Party Pack** - Tank debuff that you take out, does falloff damage. Swap every time on this probably.
* **Goblin Gravi-Gun** - 20% dmg taken and 5% MS reduction a stack.  Might line up well with above mechanic, or otherwise probably swap on 5-10 stacks.

# The One-Armed Bandit - Boss 6

Main mechanic is **Spin-to-Win**. Spawns a bunch of **Reel Assistants** that carry tokens. Several different type of tokens. You deposit the tokens into the boss and then get a mechanic based on the combination.  **CANNOT REPEAT COMBINATIONS, AND CANNOT...NOT DO THE MECHANIC. DOING SO IS A WIPE**.

 **Reel Assistants** have 3 mechs. High priority kick called **Overload**, does aoe dmg and knocks everyone back. **Withering Flames**, which is a debuff that does high dmg and reduces Max HP. Spawns Rashok waves upon expiration or dispel. SPREAD. Does high nature dmg to its target that chains to other people.

Token Types
* Shock
* Flame
* Coin
* Bomb
Combos (Shock combos are significantly more complicated than others)
* Shock and Coin - Creates a **Premium Currency Coil**, which pulls in everyone towards it, doing AoE damage over the duration. Activating this Coil does 18M dmg and absorbs the nearest 2 **Shocking Fields**.
* Shock and Flame - Creates a **Superheated Coil**, sending out **Traveling Flames** upon activation and creation. Rashok waves that knock you back. Activating this Coil does 18M dmg and absorbs the nearest 2 **Shocking Fields**.
* Shock and Bomb - Creates a **Dynamite-Laden Coil**, which spawns **Dynamite Booty** upon activation or creation. Dynamite Booty chases players for 12 seconds. If they reach the target, it deals high raid damage and puts a dot on the raid. They don't get faster over time and are relatively low HP and can be cc'ed.
* Flame and Coin - High Fire AoE dmg to the whole raid for its duration
* Flame and Bomb - Spawns **Dynamite Booty** with 100% increased HP and 50% reduced MS. Also explodes on death, dealing high damage to anything within 15 yards.
* Coin and Bomb - Spawns **Premium Dynamite Booty**, which has 100% increased HP and 50% dmg and is cc immune.

After all of these are exhausted, he'll enter Stage Two, "cheating" and doing a specific order of combos. Final combo is hard enrage, as he'll just blow everyone up (Bomb/Bomb/Bomb).

OTHER MECHANICS

* T**he Big Hit** - Tank Buster that you swap on every time. Leaves behind a **Shocking Field** (lightning ground floor that makes you take more damage). 
* **Pay-Line** - Sends a big ass coin towards random players. Leaves a field behind that gives a movement speed and dmg/healing buff (10%). Does high dmg and stuns anything hit by it. Explodes when it reaches its destination and falls over. Anything hit by this explosion (15 yd radius) takes 5M dmg. ALL players take 1M dmg. **EVERY COIN STILL ON THE FLOOR GIVES THE BOSS A 5% DMG INCREASE**. **You can kick these back at the boss to get rid of them and extend the dmg buff**.
* **Foul Exhaust** - Raid dmg and heal absorb.

**P2**

Keeps everything from P1 except Reel Assistants. Like I said, there's 4 specific combos, with the final one being a raid wipe. He keeps abilities from previous combo until death, however.

**First Combo - Linked Machines**
* Boss will make **Hyper Coils**. Also knocks everyone back when they spawn and when they're activated.These are all linked to the boss with a **Voltaic Streak**, which is a one-shot beam. Basically, don't cross the blue(?) line.
* Just like before, you can also activate these, doing 18M dmg and sucking in 2 **Shocking Fields**. Just remember it does a knockback when you activate.

**Second Combo - Hot Hot Heat**
* Marks several players and then sends out a line of flames towards them, doing high fire dmg to anything struck. Think Zskarn.

**Third Combo - Scattered Payout**
* Moderate AoE dmg every 2 secs until it dies

**Fourth Combo - Explosive Payout (Wipe)**
* Kills everyone...it's a wipe.

# Mug'zee - Boss 7

Two-headed Ogre. Based on how many players are on Mug or Zee's side of the room, the boss will do different abilities. Also, he has a buff, **Moxie**, increasing his dmg done per stack. Switching sides will remove the buff (think Kurog).

Activating Mug will do **Elemental Carnage**, afflicting them with **Elemental Calamity** for 2 mins.
Activating Zee will do **Uncontrolled Destruction**, afflicting them with **Uncontrolled Burn** for 2 mins.

This is basically to stop you from spam swapping sides.

He also has an energy bar, and will wipe the raid if it hits full. Nothing in the dungeon journal to indicate what clears it, but I'm assuming swapping sides will deplete his energy. In P2, there is obviously no way to clear his energy so you just hard wipe there.

**Mug Abilities** 

Big thing here is the **Gallgio Goons**. These are spawned by the boss and seem to be able to tanked normally.

* Mug will command the **Goons** to lock down several players in a **Gaol**. Seems to be a circle soak kinda thing, as it splits damage which other players. Needs probably 3 people minimum. If you overlap this with any others, you're dead (enrages it making it do 500% more dmg). You also can't have everyone leave the Gaol it leaves behind, or it will enrage it as well.
* The **Goon** will also do a frontal, doing 2.5M dmg to anything hit.
* The **Goon** will cast **Pay Respects**, an interruptible cast that gives a high health absorb to the boss. Insta kick it. Probably a kick order thing.
* When the **Goon** dies, does dmg to everything still in the **Gaol** and leaves behind a damage field where the **Gaol** was for 2 minutes. You'll probably need to actually coordinate where each Goon and Gaol spawn at so the room isn't filled up. If you drag the **Goon** through the **Gaol** it insta kills it.

Other mechanics for **Mug**.

* **Iceblock Boots -** Puts a debuff on several players, giving them a dot and causing them to slide for 8 seconds. When it expires, **Mug will hurl a Frostshatter Spear** towards them.
* **Frostshatter Spear** - Does 18M dmg to the first ***thing*** hit (out of players, Earthen Walls, or Crawler Mines).
* **Stormfury Finger Gun -** Frontal cone that does 1.2M nature dmg every 0.5s for 4s. Seems to leave behind a **Stormfury Cloud** that does 1.2M nature dmg and stuns anything hit by lightning strikes under the cloud for 2s. Probably need to aim this in good spots as well.
* **Molten Gold Knuckles -** Frontal tank cone that also knocks back ANYONE hit. This ability is a little complicated, so I'll break it down a bit here.
Anyone hit by it gets a debuff called **Golden Drip**. This debuff lasts 10 seconds. While they have this debuff, they drop pools that last for 3 minutes. EACH POOL THEY CREATE REMOVES A STACK OF THE DEBUFF. IF YOU DO NOT GET RID OF EVERY STACK, YOU GET STUNNED FOR 30 SECONDS. It is not know exactly how you get rid of stacks. It might be an ExtraActionButton, as it seems like you have a way to force removal, or perhaps you get a vehicle bar. Either way, tank mechanic KEK.

**Zee Abilities**

Main mechanic of this side is Unstable Crawler Mines, but they're pretty simple.

 * Zee will scatter a bunch of **Unstable Crawler Mines**, which fixate on players and explode when coming in contact with them or Earthshaker Gaols. **Frostshatter Spears** will also destroy them. Triggering these will knock back the player and afflict them with a debuff making them take increased dmg from triggering these. Triggering these ALSO causes a barrage of **Searing Shrapnel** and an **Unstable Cluster Bomb**.
 * **Unstable Cluster Bomb -** Spawns a bunch of swirlies that need(?) to be soaked. Soaking them gives you **Searing Shrapnel**, a dot and healing absorb combo. ANY SWIRLIES NOT SOAKED SEEM TO APPLY SEARING SHRAPNEL TO THE WHOLE RAID FROM THE DESCRIPTION, BUT UNSURE AT THIS TIME.
 * **Goblin Guided Rocket** - Boss will spawn a **Volunteer Rocketeer**, who will shoot a payload at a player's location. This will do 18M dmg, split amongst all players within 12 yds and creating a **Hot Mess**, which is, you guessed it, a persisting damage field. And, guess what? Anyone who soaks gets a debuff preventing them from soaking another one. Crazy.
 * After they do their main mechanic the **Rocketeer** just beams people for increasing damage and jumps around.
 * The debuff you get from soaking is called **Radiation Sickness,** and lasts a minute. Makes you take 500% increased dmg from **Goblin Guided Rocket**.
 * Spray and Pray - Cone that does dmg. Dodge.
 * Mk II Electro Shocker - Boss will summon 2 adds that do chain lightnings. Final target of the chain takes the most dmg. At 80% HP the add will take 200% increased dmg for 18 seconds. Not 100% sure how this will play out. Doesn't seem all that threatening but I'm sure it'll get buffed to be so. obviously, you want to cleave them down to 80% then hard swap to them.
 * **Double Whammy Shot (tank mechanic)** - Boss will pick a target and shoot a line at them, doing 25M dmg to the **CLOSEST** target in the line. The dmg after mitigation is dealt to everyone in the line (including original target). The original target will get an **Explosive Payload**, which does 9M dmg after 6 seconds to anyone within 15 yds and also blows up any **Unstable Crawler Mines**, presumably without giving them the debuff. Also will give the tank who soaks it a bleed that stacks. Lasts 45 seconds.

**INTERMISSION**

At 40% HP the boss will do a big dodge situation as well as charge people and do AOE dmg. After that, he'll use ALL abilities from both heads.

* Static Charge - He'll pick a player and charge at them, doing damage to the entire raid based on how many people are hit. No debuff for soaking...pog. You also take dmg from soaking this, but it's light.
* Bulletstorm - He'll spin in place for 8 seconds, doing a frontal-backal. Either you take lightning or take bullets. Both obvi not good.

**P3**

All abilities. There's a lot...GLHF. LUST. LUST. LUST THIS PHASE ITS ASS. Hard enrages when he gets full energy so yeah. Also still has **Moxie**, so he'll do more and more damage.

* **Bloodlust -** Boss will lust and get 30% haste for 40 seconds.
